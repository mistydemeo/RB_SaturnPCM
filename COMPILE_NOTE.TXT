To compile this app, you'll need some stuff included in the RB library (libRB.a),
which can be found on my website: http://www.rockin-b.de/librb.html

However, this archive contains a precompiled libRB.a,
which works when compiling on Windows using Dev-Cpp.

NOTE: the access to the WAVE file header assumes little endian, it has not yet been made compatible with big endian machines like those non-intel ones running MacOS X..
